Welcome to my Are You Still There?? app! I made a little game the user can play while waiting for the modal to open. Just type the red character at the top of the screen- your score will increase and a new character will render. See how many you can get in ten seconds. Lower case, upper case, numbers, and special characters will all be generated. Your high score will be stored and persist (mine's currently 13).
